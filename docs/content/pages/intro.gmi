# Gemican

Gemican is a static Gemini capsule generator, written in Python.

It is based on the static site generator, Pelican.

Highlights include:

* Write your content directly with your editor of choice in Gemtext or Markdown formats
* Includes a simple CLI tool to (re)generate your site
* Easy to interface with distributed version control systems and web hooks
* Completely static output is easy to host anywhere

## Features

Gemicanâ€™s feature highlights include:

* Articles (e.g., blog posts) and pages (e.g., "About", "Projects", "Contact")
* Integration with external services
* Site themes (created using Jinja2)
* Publication of articles in multiple languages
* Generation of Atom and RSS feeds
* Import existing content from WordPress, Dotclear, or RSS feeds
* Fast rebuild times thanks to content caching and selective output writing
* Extensible via plugins

## Why the name "Gemican"?

"Gemican" is an anagram of *camegin*, which means nothing in any language.

Only joking - Gemican is based on the Pelican static site generator, and took its name from that.
