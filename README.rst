Source code
-----------

Gemican's source code is `hosted on GitHub`_. If you feel like hacking,
take a look at `Pelican's internals`_, since Gemican doesn't have its own
documentation yet and is mostly identical to Pelican.


Why the name "Gemican"?
-----------------------

"Gemican" is an anagram of *camegin*, which means nothing.
